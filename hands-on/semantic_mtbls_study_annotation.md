# Agenda Summary 
## Current State Overview (WP1)
  + Team presents the current status of WP1 (5-10 min).

  + RCI-M WP1 team presents results from efforts to improve this current state (30-35 min).


## Key Concepts and Tools
  + Brief introduction to MetaboLights.
  + Explanation of MetaboLights exemplar studies and their relevance. 
  + Discussion on ontologies:


    + Why ontologies are needed.
    + Which tools are useful to search for ontologies and map free text to ontology terms.
    + Which ontologies are relevant.
    + Whether and how to improve existing ontologies.


## Future Directions
  + Next steps toward FAIR data, including:
    + Linked data.
    + Improved search.
    + Better interoperability.

  + Standards to consider (e.g., ISA).
  + Overview of other initiatives that aim to improve the current state (15 minutes):
    + Examples: FAIRly, MetabolomicsHub, MOMSI.
    + Opportunities for synergies or collaborations.
    + Decide on session format (discussion, slides, survey, etc.).


## Hands-On Session (1.5–2 hours)
  
  + Practical work involving producing or improving annotations.

  + Tasks:
    + Select up to three studies from MetaboLights (optionally pre-identified).
    + Evaluate and curate these studies.
    + Identify ontology gaps and missing information.
    + Improve annotations and find missing elements (e.g., publications, files).


  + Logistics:
    + Define rules: self-paced or guided with checkpoints.

    + Possibly split participants into groups focused on:
      + Samples
      + Assays
      + Metabolites (results)

  + Wrap-up with feedback to the whole group.
